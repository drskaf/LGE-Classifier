# LGE Image Classification
This repository is created to train and test 2 groups of models:
1. A classification model to classify each of the 17 AHA segments with binary values
2. Outcome prediction models to predict mortality and ventricular arrhythmia\

## Scripts:
aha_lge.py for training AHA classifier /
lge_test.py for testing AHA classifier /
mixed_mortality_nn.py for mortality prediction with mixed data type /
mixed_vt_nn.py for ventricular arrhythmia prediction with mixed data type /
test_outcome.py for testing both prediction models /
